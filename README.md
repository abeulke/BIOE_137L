Through this excerise you will use R and RStudio to learn a number of useful skills. 

  1. How to get a data table into R
  2. How to manipulate that data table to complete your analyses
  3. How to plot your data
  4. How to compute a linear regression
  5. How to create and use a function in R
 
 We will learn all these skills as we work with the height and weight dataset I presented during lecture. We will then use R to complete the linear regression of these two variables, calculate the R<sup>2</sup> and its p-value.
